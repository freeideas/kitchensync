Test-Fix-Loop Report
===================

Date: 2025-10-02

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Platform-specific path separator in ArchiveManager unit test
**Location:** ArchiveManager.java:134-140 (getArchivePath_TEST_)
**Problem:** Test was checking for Unix-style path separators (`/`) but on Windows, paths use backslashes (`\`).
**Fix:** Normalized paths by replacing backslashes with forward slashes before checking path patterns.
**Lines changed:** 134-143

### Issue 2: Multiple archive timestamps for single sync operation
**Location:** ArchiveManager.java archiveFile() and archiveDirectory()
**Problem:** Each call to archiveFile() and archiveDirectory() created a new timestamp, resulting in separate timestamped directories for files and directories archived during the same sync operation. The end-user test expected all archived items to be in a single timestamped directory.
**Fix:** Implemented session-level timestamp management using beginArchiveSession()/endArchiveSession() methods. Added these calls in FileSyncer.syncDirectories() to ensure all archives in a sync operation share the same timestamp.
**Files modified:**
- ArchiveManager.java: Added sessionTimestamp, beginArchiveSession(), endArchiveSession(), getTimestamp()
- FileSyncer.java: Wrapped syncDirectoryContents() with try-finally to manage archive session

## Test Results
- All 6 unit test classes pass
- All 9 end-user tests pass
- Build succeeds (both JAR and native executable)

## Documentation Accuracy
No significant inaccuracies found in README.md or SPECIFICATION.md. The documentation accurately describes the expected behavior.
