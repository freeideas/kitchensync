There is a bug that was not caught in testing. Below you will find the report about the bug.

Please:

1) Make any changes to @README.md or to @SPECIFICATION.md or to one of the documents referenced by it, but only if clarification is needed about this behavior. If is is already clear from the documentation that this is a bug, then there is no need to update. If you modify documentation, remember to be brief and concise.
2) Create or update a test in @scripts/test.py or one of the tests that is run by that script. If it is something that should be in a unit test, put it there instead.
3) Verify that the test fails (and fails for the right reason).
4) Fix the root cause.
5) Verify that the test succeeds.
6) Run ./scripts/build.py if ./release/ has not yet been updated with the fix.
7) Write a report to ./reports/bug-fix_report.md; be sure to say whether there needs to be further changes to documentation.
