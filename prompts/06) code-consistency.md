Read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md for background.

Please find every *.md document in this tree of files (but ignore the ./prompts directory), and verify that the source code is consistent with it.
Make any code changes needed for consistency.

You should first find all the .md files, then make a plan for which files to compare against which code, so you won't have to remember all the .md files at once.
