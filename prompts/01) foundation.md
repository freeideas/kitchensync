Please create the skeleton of this project. It will have minimal code and minimal documentation; only what is needed to accomplish the goal.

1) README.md - a background about this project; written for all audiences.
2) SPECIFICATION.md - the specification of the project; written for experienced developers who have already read README.md.
3) ./scripts/build.py - builds the final output, and copies it to ./release/
4) ./scripts/test.py - tests the final output
5) ./scripts/install.py - installs from the ./release/ directory; called by ./scripts/test.py

Remember that we run .py scripts with uv run --script; not python directly.

Do not create arbitrary specifications that would be easily discovered by the developers with real-life experience.



(DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE; IT SHOULD BE REUSABLE ACROSS PROJECTS)
