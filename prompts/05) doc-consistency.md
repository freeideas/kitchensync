Please read @README.md and @SPECIFICATION.md, and make sure they:

1) agree with each other
2) have very little overlap
3) SPECIFICATION.md is targeted at developers who have already read README.md
4) README.md is for everyone else
5) SPECIFICATION.md does not have source code which an experienced developer will already know how to write
6) are concise and not overly verbose

Compare these files to any other *.md files you can find in this tree of files, except for the ./prompts directory.

Don't make any changes yet, but report your proposed changes to ./reports/doc-consistency_report.md
